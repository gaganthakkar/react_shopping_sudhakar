react is a single page application, meaning the content has been changed but the page remains the same

e.g. flipcart, netflix

by writing & you can get many symbols on the HTML 

<ol type="" starts ="">

whenever we install any pacakge, it will generate node module and packgae json objects into

the packages are nothing but the dependencies or called the supporting package

we can install the react app in many ways, here we use the longer way to install the react app, by downloading npm i "name of the react app"

the shortcut command for creating the react app is package

npx create-react-app appname

This is one step npm code to install the react app


-   there is also two line npm code to install the react appname


npm i -g create-react-app 

then go inside the folder using cmd and

create-react-app appname





/////STEP TO RUN REACT APP////STEP

npm start




react   -> it is the main library
react-dom   -> used to render the content
react-scripts -> react script help to run the application

are the main package we require in the react while coding.



-THREE TYPES OF REACT COMPONENT

1. class component
2. functional component
3. hooks component


* Class component
- logical component         ( use for calling API, writing logic, display purpose)
- they can maintain state
- class cannot return(), class have a method called render() and inside the render, it returns

* Functional component
- Dumb component            (use for display purpose)
- they cannot maintain state

STATE AND PROPS

STATE
- state act like a local component or variable
- every component can have its own state
- state can be acessible in same component or nested        // nested meaning it is connected....meaning export import thing
- we can update the value of the state

PROPS

- Props help to transfer the data
- Data can be transfer in between nested components
- We cannot update the value of state
